Photography experience specific to equine photography:
  One of my equine photos was included in my gallery exhibit (of 12 photos) at Madison Union Art Galleries at James Madison University in 2011.
  Current equine / equestrian photography project (summer 2017): visually telling the story of the farriers' role in horses hoof care

My horse experience:
 I've been riding since 1997	
 My family owned horses from 2000-2011. 
	I gained valuable riding skills and equine knowledge from curriculum of the United States Pony Clubs (USPC). 
	I was a member of the USPC Crescent Bay Pony Club chapter (based in Chesapeake, VA) from 1997-2008
o	My highest rating achieved was a C-1 
	Link if you're curious about what C-1 level standards are: https://www.ponyclub.org/ContentDocs/Instruction/Standards/2016%20SOP%20C-1C-2%20Level%20HSE.pdf 

	While I do not currently own a horse, I still ride (only about once a week) and plan to own a horse again someday.
