    "Details":"The work I do with animals and humans is very similar.  I work intuitively, sometimes with a focus on a particular issueinjury, illness, emotions.  Other times, I just get out of the way and let the energy work its magic.  There is no modality or methodology.  I just bring a Gift that effects mind, body and spirit in miraculous ways. \n\nA key difference when working with animals is communication.  Humans, generally speaking, have a pretty good grasp of what's going on with them and can share verbally. With horses and other four-legged friends, things are a little different.  Human companions can share with me a veterinarian's diagnosis or describe symptoms. Sometimes they are right but, again, generally speaking, that's not the entire picture.  So, when working with animals I listen.  I'm not an animal communicator' in the sense that most people presume one to be.  I just listen' with all of my senses and allow an animal's response to me and the energy guide how I move and breathe.  \n\nThere are those who attempt to explain how the energy works.  The truth is, no one knows.  In my case, the only thing I know is that it does work. It works on dramatically shortening recovery time after acute injury; elimination of chronic injury and illness; emotional & physical trauma; behavioral issues for which no one else has found solutions.  I can't explain it and don't go looking for the how or why.  I just watch lame and wild horses transform into healthy, happy, active creatures.  I see paralyzed pooches wag, walk and otherwise be hale and hearty.\n\nThe fee for animal work (including distance healing) is $85 for one hour.\n\nFor testimonials, please go to: http:\/\/www.uncommontouch.info\/UnCommonTouch.com\/Animal_Work.html"

    "Details":"Is your horse performing at their best? Want that extra edge? Try equine massage therapy.\nThe benefits of equine massage therapy are expansive, including the following:\nHelps to Prevent Injury \u2013 As you exercise your horse, you are building up his muscle. This is done when many small tears are made in the muscle fibers during exercise, which are then repaired with scar tissue over the next couple days. Massage helps to break down the scar tissue, allowing muscles to be elastic and flexible.\nImproves Circulation \u2013 Massage dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow to the area. Increased circulation can help speed recovery of injured muscle tissues and restore mobility.\nIncrease Range of Motion \u2013 Between stretching tissues, improving muscle tone and lowering stiffness and swelling, equine massage therapy can expand a horse's range of motion, allowing them to become more effective under saddle.\nReduces Stress \u2013 Horses experience stress and anxiety just like we do, and massage relaxes them just as it does us. When muscles are rubbed, there is a sedative effect on the nervous system, which helps with relaxation and can improve disposition.\nCall Alogo Equine Massage for all your massage needs.\nKatie Bromley (540)272-2891\nOffer multi horse discounts"

While operating her own training business and competing at high levels of performance, Katie realizes that a tense muscle is not a well performing muscle. And much like a chain reaction, when one muscle is tense other muscles tend to follow suit. To perform well we have to feel great!

    "Details":"Get direct feedback from your horse to help \n\uf0fc\t-guide veterinary and holistic care \n\uf0fc\t-direct your training efforts \n\uf0fc\t-build a better relationship with your horse\n\nDespite our best efforts, sometimes the health and behavior of our horses leaves us confused and frustrated.  It seems like every step in equine training and care involves a million decisions that leave us wondering, did it work?  Animal communication can shorten this process by giving us feedback directly from the horse.  Better yet, communicating with your horse is the fastest way to improve your relationship.\n\nCall Marcia when you want to ask you horse:\n\tWhere does he hurt?\n\tWhat's stopping her from getting well?\n\tWhy is she behaving badly?\n\tWhy isn't he responding to training?\n\tIs he ready to leave life? \n\nTeam Player\nMarcia is a team player. Animal communication never replaces good veterinary care, rather it helps you find the pain.  Marcia tells you how the situation feels to your horse.  She will work with you or the vet and describe the specific nature of the problem. \nFor example, when you ask why my horse won't eat, he could have pain in his teeth or stomach, smell something odd in his food, or be depressed. With this knowledge, you and your vet can decide which steps to take. Marcia makes farm calls locally or consults over the phone at any distance.\n\nEmotional Healing\nTransitions in home, ownership, and jobs; rescue, sickness, and pain, can all affect a horse's emotions and make it difficult for them to move forward with life and healing.  Using communication and energy work, Marcia can help the horse release emotional blocks to connecting and working with their owners. \n\nEnd of Life Care\nOur most difficult decision can be how to help out animals at the end of life.  Marcia can help you decide if the animal is ready to go, celebrate his life, and ease his passage with communication and energy when the time comes.  You and your horse can grow closer in the process and ease the pain of loss by knowing that you helped them to go with love and compassion.\n\nAbout Marcia\nMarcia is a Certified Reiki Master and professional animal communicator. Marcia works with veterinarians, owners and their horses to improve health, behaviors, and relationships. Marcia is also trained in holistic natural horseman techniques to help develop a positive working relationship between horse and owner.  Communicating with animals since childhood, Marcia took time out to pursue degrees and work in Veterinary Technology, Molecular Biology, Technical and Science Communication, and a teaching certificate before returning to her first love, animal communication. \n\nMarcia follows a strict code of ethics, believing that all communications between you and your animal should remain private unless you desire otherwise.\n\nEmail Marcia@marciatalks.com or text\/call 540-270-7741 for an appointment.\n\nPhoto: Marcia using communication and energy work to assist equine osteopath Dr. Ann-Marie Hancock as she makes physical adjustments."

    "Details":"~N~Touch massage therapy is dedicated to helping our best friends, our horses and our dogs! If you have ever had a massage then you know how great it feels\n\n\nDescription\n\nIn all my years on this earth, I never dreamed I would be where I' am right now. I have a huge love of animals and I have always hated to see them suffer. Whether it was an injury or suffering at the hands of man. \n I have trained horses the better part of 30 yrs. I always knew there was something more to offer our training horses but could never put my finger on it. Then one day I was rubbing down a horse and he felt knotted up in his back and hind quarters. I then started to rub him down with a form of massage. \n He improved and was very happy after training and waited patiently for a rub down after his work. \n So at that point I have used this on just about all the horses that I have handled. \n Did I know what I was really doing...NO. But it made the horses happy and easier to handle. Just this past April 2014 I made my dreams come true and enrolled in the Equissage massage therapy certification course for Equine and \/Canine therapy.\n This is where I met an awesome woman by the name of Mary Schreiber. My mentor and instructor. My life has changed since that first day in Mary's classroom in the basement of her farm house in Roundhill Va. We are friends and I still enjoy out little conversations when time permits! I want to thank her for all the confidence she gave me through my time spent there! I will always keep her dear to my heart! Now as Mary said\" I have a dream to massage every horse in the world just once....so that each might be favored with the release from pain that any good massage is capable of bringing to the body\" So we will massage on!!!! \n\nThe Benefits of massage.\nEquine sports massage therapy is a non-invasive therapy that aids in the total health of your horse. Your horse's body weight is 60% muscle thus tension and tightening in any part of your horse's body reduces the effectiveness of the whole body.\n\n The benefits of an equine sports massage are many. Circulation is improved, thus promoting more rapid healing of injuries. Muscle tone is enhanced and range of motion is increased. Muscle spasms are eased and tension is relieved. Stimulates circulation in the lymphatic system thus hastening the elimination of waste products and other toxins. Connective tissue is lengthened thus preventing the formation of adhesions. Disposition can also improve. \n\n Compression is the stroke that separates sports massage from other types of massage. When muscle is compressed against the bone, the muscle fibers spread apart. This action frees the restrictions and adhesions in the muscle and allows the blood supply to flow easily into the muscle. The increased blood flow carries oxygen and nutrients to the muscle and aids in removing metabolic waste. Compression is used to break up adhesions in the bellies of the muscle. \n\n An equine sports massage is non-discriminatory. All equine breeds and all disciplines will benefit. \nMaintains the entire body in better physical condition\nAids in preventing injuries and loss of mobility\nBoosts athletic performance and endurance\nRestores mobility to injured muscle tissue\nExtends the good health and overall life of the horse's athletic career\n If your horse is also currently having Chiropractic work done, follow up with Sports massage, even if you fix a skeletal issue, you still have to retrain and work the muscles so the horse can benefit fully from the Chiropractic work performed. \n\n Call or Email today for an appointment. (757) 876-7705\n tracey@firemansrunfarm.com use ( Sports Massage Appt) in the Header in case it goes to Spam mail. Thank you for your interest in E&C Massage Therapy."

    "Details":"Whether your horse is a longtime companion for pleasure riding, a competitive barrel racer or is a champion athlete competing at the Grand Prix level or fits somewhere in between. At one time or another, every horse owner has had concerns for their horse's well-being and performance. \nPerhaps your equine partner has had some recent performance changes when you ask him to go up a steep incline on a course, to take that cutting turn, move laterally with ease, or simply to lift his leg so you can look at his hoof. Maybe at first you don't think much of it, he's just having an \"off\" day. But then he starts nipping or kicking when you touch or are just near a certain part of his body. Often times these behavior changes can be due to pain from connective tissue that has tightened and simply won't allow movement without pain. After a while they will simply stop doing that particular movement in order to avoid pain, and can act out negatively in an effort to protect the problem area.\nYou and your horse have been regularly progressing in training and then one day you notice you have reached a plateau.\nIs his\/her stride shorter than it used to be?\nHow's that extension or collection?\nIs your horse able to pick up both leads with ease when asked?\t\nDoes your horse feel balanced?\nIt is not always obvious when there is a connective tissue problem if there has not been an injury. If you have experienced any of the above, and have tried other healing modalities without success then it's time to give Structural Integration bodywork a try. Contact me today!"
