I work intuitively, sometimes with a focus on a particular issueinjury, illness, emotions.  Other times, I just get out of the way and let the energy work its magic.  There is no modality or methodology.  I just bring a Gift that effects mind, body and spirit in miraculous ways. 

A key difference when working with animals is communication.  Humans, generally speaking, have a pretty good grasp of what's going on with them and can share verbally. With horses and other four-legged friends, things are a little different.  Human companions can share with me a veterinarian's diagnosis or describe symptoms. Sometimes they are right but, again, generally speaking, that's not the entire picture.  So, when working with animals I listen.  I'm not an animal communicator' in the sense that most people presume one to be.  I just listen' with all of my senses and allow an animal's response to me and the energy guide how I move and breathe.  

There are those who attempt to explain how the energy works.  The truth is, no one knows.  In my case, the only thing I know is that it does work. It works on dramatically shortening recovery time after acute injury; elimination of chronic injury and illness; emotional & physical trauma; behavioral issues for which no one else has found solutions.  I can't explain it and don't go looking for the how or why.  I just watch lame and wild horses transform into healthy, happy, active creatures.  I see paralyzed pooches wag, walk and otherwise be hale and hearty.

The fee for animal work (including distance healing) is $85 for one hour.

The benefits of equine massage therapy are expansive, including the following:
Helps to Prevent Injury â€“ As you exercise your horse, you are building up his muscle. This is done when many small tears are made in the muscle fibers during exercise, which are then repaired with scar tissue over the next couple days. Massage helps to break down the scar tissue, allowing muscles to be elastic and flexible.
Improves Circulation â€“ Massage dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow to the area. Increased circulation can help speed recovery of injured muscle tissues and restore mobility.
Increase Range of Motion â€“ Between stretching tissues, improving muscle tone and lowering stiffness and swelling, equine massage therapy can expand a horse's range of motion, allowing them to become more effective under saddle.
Reduces Stress â€“ Horses experience stress and anxiety just like we do, and massage relaxes them just as it does us. When muscles are rubbed, there is a sedative effect on the nervous system, which helps with relaxation and can improve disposition.
Call Alogo Equine Massage for all your massage needs.

ïƒ¼	-guide veterinary and holistic care 
ïƒ¼	-direct your training efforts 
ïƒ¼	-build a better relationship with your horse

Despite our best efforts, sometimes the health and behavior of our horses leaves us confused and frustrated.  It seems like every step in equine training and care involves a million decisions that leave us wondering, did it work?  Animal communication can shorten this process by giving us feedback directly from the horse.  Better yet, communicating with your horse is the fastest way to improve your relationship.

Call Marcia when you want to ask you horse:
	Where does he hurt?
	What's stopping her from getting well?
	Why is she behaving badly?
	Why isn't he responding to training?
	Is he ready to leave life? 

Team Player
Marcia is a team player. Animal communication never replaces good veterinary care, rather it helps you find the pain.  Marcia tells you how the situation feels to your horse.  She will work with you or the vet and describe the specific nature of the problem. 
For example, when you ask why my horse won't eat, he could have pain in his teeth or stomach, smell something odd in his food, or be depressed. With this knowledge, you and your vet can decide which steps to take. Marcia makes farm calls locally or consults over the phone at any distance.

Emotional Healing
Transitions in home, ownership, and jobs; rescue, sickness, and pain, can all affect a horse's emotions and make it difficult for them to move forward with life and healing.  Using communication and energy work, Marcia can help the horse release emotional blocks to connecting and working with their owners. 

End of Life Care
Our most difficult decision can be how to help out animals at the end of life.  Marcia can help you decide if the animal is ready to go, celebrate his life, and ease his passage with communication and energy when the time comes.  You and your horse can grow closer in the process and ease the pain of loss by knowing that you helped them to go with love and compassion.

About Marcia
Marcia is a Certified Reiki Master and professional animal communicator. Marcia works with veterinarians, owners and their horses to improve health, behaviors, and relationships. Marcia is also trained in holistic natural horseman techniques to help develop a positive working relationship between horse and owner.  Communicating with animals since childhood, Marcia took time out to pursue degrees and work in Veterinary Technology, Molecular Biology, Technical and Science Communication, and a teaching certificate before returning to her first love, animal communication. 

Marcia follows a strict code of ethics, believing that all communications between you and your animal should remain private unless you desire otherwise.

Description

In all my years on this earth, I never dreamed I would be where I' am right now. I have a huge love of animals and I have always hated to see them suffer. Whether it was an injury or suffering at the hands of man. 
 I have trained horses the better part of 30 yrs. I always knew there was something more to offer our training horses but could never put my finger on it. Then one day I was rubbing down a horse and he felt knotted up in his back and hind quarters. I then started to rub him down with a form of massage. 
 He improved and was very happy after training and waited patiently for a rub down after his work. 
 So at that point I have used this on just about all the horses that I have handled. 
 Did I know what I was really doing...NO. But it made the horses happy and easier to handle. Just this past April 2014 I made my dreams come true and enrolled in the Equissage massage therapy certification course for Equine and /Canine therapy.
 This is where I met an awesome woman by the name of Mary Schreiber. My mentor and instructor. My life has changed since that first day in Mary's classroom in the basement of her farm house in Roundhill Va. We are friends and I still enjoy out little conversations when time permits! I want to thank her for all the confidence she gave me through my time spent there! I will always keep her dear to my heart! Now as Mary said"" I have a dream to massage every horse in the world just once....so that each might be favored with the release from pain that any good massage is capable of bringing to the body"" So we will massage on!!!! 

The Benefits of massage.
Equine sports massage therapy is a non-invasive therapy that aids in the total health of your horse. Your horse's body weight is 60% muscle thus tension and tightening in any part of your horse's body reduces the effectiveness of the whole body.

 The benefits of an equine sports massage are many. Circulation is improved, thus promoting more rapid healing of injuries. Muscle tone is enhanced and range of motion is increased. Muscle spasms are eased and tension is relieved. Stimulates circulation in the lymphatic system thus hastening the elimination of waste products and other toxins. Connective tissue is lengthened thus preventing the formation of adhesions. Disposition can also improve. 

 Compression is the stroke that separates sports massage from other types of massage. When muscle is compressed against the bone, the muscle fibers spread apart. This action frees the restrictions and adhesions in the muscle and allows the blood supply to flow easily into the muscle. The increased blood flow carries oxygen and nutrients to the muscle and aids in removing metabolic waste. Compression is used to break up adhesions in the bellies of the muscle. 

 An equine sports massage is non-discriminatory. All equine breeds and all disciplines will benefit. 
Maintains the entire body in better physical condition
Aids in preventing injuries and loss of mobility
Boosts athletic performance and endurance
Restores mobility to injured muscle tissue
Extends the good health and overall life of the horse's athletic career
 If your horse is also currently having Chiropractic work done, follow up with Sports massage, even if you fix a skeletal issue, you still have to retrain and work the muscles so the horse can benefit fully from the Chiropractic work performed.

It is used for the purpose of improving circulation, increasing blood oxygen, stimulating the lymphatic system, relaxing muscle spasms, relieving tension, enhancing muscle tone, and increasing range of motion in high performance horses.

That is straight from Magna Wave, which is a brad of PEMF equipment. I think of PEMF as a way to provide a deep tissue massage with the benefits of magnetic therapy. Below are just some of the benefits of PEMF Therapy;

Improves blood flow
Stimulates the lymphatic system
Stimulates the acupuncture points
Improves blood oxygen levels by increasing cell permeability
Increasing range of motion

For many of us horse is a large animal that we cannot really keep at home. We have the dream of having one, being friends with one and riding one. So many of us just go to a farm a ride one and get all sorts of experiences, good or bad. For many  this dream is impossible to realize. For some it falls flat on expectations. 

Our Farm and Team started with a dream of understanding horse's way.  The horses we ride are partners. It is perhaps simple fact of nature, that each of them has bounded to humans in a different way. It is because each human's dream about their horse is different. It is because horses can interpret that dream in their own unique way.  In horse's way of life humans need help. And each of our horses knows that. We have helped many people to strengthen their bodies, souls and minds by developing this unique relationship between them and a horse.

Licensed Massage Therapist providing in home and in-barn services at competitive prices. A graduate of the Blue Ridge School of Massage and Yoga with 2 decades of Equine experience.

I offer multiple modalities from your luxurious Relaxation and Deep Swedish, to Sports Massage and Injury Rehabilitation, finally to Thai Yoga and Shiatsu. I can work on you, your horse, or both. 

The advantages of Massage for both of you:
-Increase circulation
-Increase muscle tone and flexibility
-Boosts your current fitness and nutrition regimen

When the horse and rider receive massage regularly from the same, quality therapist, it allows the therapist to target performance issues in both parts of the team. Holding stress in your neck affects how easily your horse can bend through a corner, just as an old injury in your horse can affect your leg communication.

At one time or another, every horse owner has had concerns for their horse's well-being and performance. 
Perhaps your equine partner has had some recent performance changes when you ask him to go up a steep incline on a course, to take that cutting turn, move laterally with ease, or simply to lift his leg so you can look at his hoof. Maybe at first you don't think much of it, he's just having an ""off"" day. But then he starts nipping or kicking when you touch or are just near a certain part of his body. Often times these behavior changes can be due to pain from connective tissue that has tightened and simply won't allow movement without pain. After a while they will simply stop doing that particular movement in order to avoid pain, and can act out negatively in an effort to protect the problem area.
You and your horse have been regularly progressing in training and then one day you notice you have reached a plateau.
Is his/her stride shorter than it used to be?
How's that extension or collection?
Is your horse able to pick up both leads with ease when asked?	
Does your horse feel balanced?
It is not always obvious when there is a connective tissue problem if there has not been an injury. If you have experienced any of the above, and have tried other healing modalities without success then it's time to give Structural Integration bodywork a try. Contact me today!"

As a rider you owe it to your horse to seek out those modalities that help you ride your best.

These problems hinder and frustrate, and in many cases prevent the advancement of your skills as a rider.  Reducing stress and tension is also going to benefit both horse and rider.
