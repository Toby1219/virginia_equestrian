We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us.

If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help.

MANURE REMOVAL
For our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  

First the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    

We also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with an empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. 

MANURE SPREADER
There is also a photo showing our rotary manure spreader dispensing manure onto our pasture.  This revolutionary manure spreader breaks the manure into tiny pieces as you spread, offering an even, easily absorbed distribution of organic fertilizer to your fields.  You can see the 5 foot wide path of evenly spread manure behind the spreader.

♦ Our footings are guaranteed non-toxic to animals, non-flammable and 99.9% wire-free. 
♦ Equestrian Rubber Footing needs no replacement -- normal maintenance is accomplished by occasional raking and water washdown. It provides excellent traction,       allows immediate drainage, and will not freeze or become slippery.
