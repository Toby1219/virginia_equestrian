    "Details":"We offer a variety of services for horse owners including reliable, affordable manure removal, spreading manure on your fields, bush hogging, and other farm related services.  We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us. \n\nWe've built our farm from scratch (it was literally a junk yard when we bought it) and we can provide advice and assistance on subjects such as building an arena, use of a sacrifice area and rotating pastures, time-saving ideas for barn design and building, fencing, etc...  If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help.\n\nMANURE REMOVAL\nFor our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  \n\nFirst the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    \n\nWe also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with an empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. \n\nMANURE SPREADER\nThere is also a photo showing our rotary manure spreader dispensing manure onto our pasture.  This revolutionary manure spreader breaks the manure into tiny pieces as you spread, offering an even, easily absorbed distribution of organic fertilizer to your fields.  You can see the 5 foot wide path of evenly spread manure behind the spreader. \n\nGive us a call and we'll be glad to help!"
